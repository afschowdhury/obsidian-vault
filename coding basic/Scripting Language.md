A script or scripting language is a computer language that does not need the compilation step and is rather interpreted one by one at runtime.[[Difference between Compiled language and Interpreted language]].
[[Compiler vs Interpreter]] . 

It is where the script is written and where instructions for a run-time environment are written. In contrast to programming languages that are compiled first before running, scripting languages do not compile the file and execute the file without being compiled.

Scripts are often utilized to create **dynamic web applications** nowadays because they are linked to web development. *Server-Side Scripting Languages and Client-Side Scripting Languages are the two types of scripting languages*. **Python, PHP, and Perl are examples of server-side scripting languages, while JavaScript is the greatest example of a client-side scripting language.** These languages are often developed with the goal of communicating with other programming languages.

**There are multiple scripting languages available some are as follows:**

-   **bash:** It is a scripting language that's the default command interpreter on most GNU/Linux systems and can be found on a variety of operating systems. As compared to other programming languages, the use of bash is much easier to create scriptsIt stores documentation for others to use, defines the tools to use and command line code, and provides useful reusable scripts. Its name is short for 'Bourne-Again SHell'.
-   **Ruby:** It is a scripting and pure object-oriented programming language that enables developers to create innovative software. It was established in 1993 by Yukihiro Matsumoto of Japan and is excellent for web development. Ruby offers the same features that are included in the languages such as Python, Perl, and Smalltalk.
-   **Node js:** Writing network applications in JavaScript is open-source and cross-platform. It is not a programming language that reads and writes files on a computer/server and handles networking, but it does employ JavaScript as the core programming interface. For real-time web applications, corporate users of Node.js include Yahoo, Netflix, PayPal, IBM, Microsoft, and LinkedIn.
-   **Python:** It is an object-oriented programming language that is the most widely used language among developers, in modern times. It is simple and interpreted. It's a dynamically semantic language with enormous scripted lines of code. It has high-level data structures built in, making it easy to use and suitable for Rapid Application Development. It supports code reuse and software modularity by allowing modules and packages.
-   **Perl:** It is a scripting as well as dynamic programming language with innovative features. These features make it popular and different from other languages. It is available on all Linux and Windows servers, which was developed by Larry Wall in 1987. Although it has no official Full form, the most used expended form is "Practical Extraction and Reporting Language. High-traffic websites widely use Perl, including IMDB, priceline.com, and it also helps in text manipulation tasks.
