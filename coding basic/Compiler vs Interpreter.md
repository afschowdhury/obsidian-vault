**1.** [**Compiler**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-compiler-design/)**:**   
It is a translator which takes input i.e., High-Level Language, and produces an output of low-level language i.e. machine or assembly language. 

-   A compiler is more intelligent than an assembler it checks all kinds of limits, ranges, errors, etc.
-   But its program run time is more and occupies a larger part of memory. It has a slow speed because a compiler goes through the entire program and then translates the entire program into machine codes.

**2.** [**Interpreter**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiler-vs-interpreter-2/)**:**   
An interpreter is a program that translates a programming language into a comprehensible language. –  

-   It translates only one statement of the program at a time.
-   Interpreters, more often than not are smaller than compilers.
