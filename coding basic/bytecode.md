**Byte code** is an intermediate code between the source code and machine code. It is a low-level code that is the result of the compilation of a source code which is written in a high-level language. It is processed by a virtual machine like [Java Virtual Machine (JVM)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/).

The below figure illustrates the arrangement of source code and byte code –
