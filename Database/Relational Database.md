- Data is stored in tabular form - *( columns and rows)* just like in the spreadsheet *( google sheets / excel sheets)*
- column contains item properties ( attributes ) such as Last Name, First name
- A table ( composed of rows and columns) in a relational database is a collection of related things just like an individual spreadsheet.  ( Employees, Sales etc)
