#tuple #python 
Tuples are also a sequence data type containing elements of different [data types](https://www.simplilearn.com/what-is-data-article "data types").

It comes in handy when storing a collection of items, especially if you want those items to be unchanging. 

A python tuple has the following features - 

-   Tuples are used to store heterogeneous and homogeneous data.
-   Tuples are immutable in nature.
-   Tuples are ordered
-   An index is used to traverse a tuple.
-   Tuples are similar to lists. It also preserves the data sequence.

### As tuples are immutable, they are faster than the list because they are static.


## Tuple Syntax

A tuple is initiated with the () symbol. 

Here’s an example of declaring a tuple in python.

```python
num_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)

print(num_tuple)

alphabets_tuple = (‘a’,‘b’,‘c’,‘d’,‘e’)

print(alphabets_tuple)

A list can contain data of different data types. You can initiate it as follows - 

mixed_tuple = (‘a’, 1,‘b,’ 2,‘c,’ 3, ‘4’).

print(mixed_tuple)

You can create nested lists as well. A nested list is a list inside a list.

nested_tuple = (1,2,3,(4,5,6),7,8)

print(nested_tuple)

```
