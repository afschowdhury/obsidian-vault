## Difference between Scripting and Programming Languages

Although all scripting languages are programming languages, they have a difference in that scripting languages directly interpret the files and do not need the compilation step. For instance, a program whitened in the scripting language like PHP or JavaScript does not need to be compiled, whereas a C program that needs to be compiled before running.

Generally, as compared to interpreted programs, compiled programs run faster as they are first converted native machine code before running. The interpreter reads and analyses the code statements every time they are encountered, and if any mistakes are discovered, it encounters them and halts at that point, whereas the compiler reads and analyses the code just once, and displays the faults that the code contains. Practically, due to the improved computation capabilities of modern hardware and advanced coding practices, the difference between scraping and programming languages is getting blurred.

When distinguishing between languages such as scripting and programming, the environment in which they will be used must be considered. The reason for this is that developers must be able to construct a compiler for a scripting language such as JavaScript and use it as a non-scripting (compiled language), as well as an interpreter for a compiled language such as C or C++ and use it as a scripting language.

V8 of Google Chrome's JavaScript engine is a real example of this. V8 converts JavaScript code into machine code rather than interpreting it. Languages like JavaScript, PHP, Python, and VBScript have generally been used without an explicit compilation step, whereas C and C++ have an explicit compilation step.
