Lists are one of the most flexible and powerful containers in Python. It is similar to an [array](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/python-tutorial/python-arrays "array") in other languages like [Java.](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/java-tutorial/what-is-java "Java.") 

The list has the following features - 

-   You can use Python lists to store data of multiple types simultaneously.
-   Lists help preserve data sequences and further process those sequences in other ways. 
-   Lists are dynamic.
-   Lists are mutable.
-   Lists are ordered.
-   An index is used to traverse a list.

Lists help store multiple items and then iterate over them using a loop. Because lists are dynamic, you can easily add or remove items anytime.

## List Syntax

A list is initiated with the [ ] symbol. 

Here’s an example of declaring a list in python.
```python
num_list = [1,2,3,4,5]

print(num_list)

alphabets_list = [‘a’,‘b’,‘c’,‘d’,‘e’]

print(alphabets_list)

#A list can contain data of different data types. You can initiate it as follows - 

mixed_list = [‘a’, 1,‘b’,2,‘c’,3,‘4’]

print(mixed_list)

#You can create nested lists as well. A nested list is a list inside a list.

nested_list = [1,2,3,[4,5,6],7,8]

print(nested_list)

```
