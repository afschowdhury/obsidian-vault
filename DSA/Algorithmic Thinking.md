A common problem in CS can have different solutions and overtime the solution gets better

part of understanding algorothm is not limited to know that an algoritm exists, but , knowing when to apply them 
Understaning when to apply an algorithm depends on understanding the **problem we have**.  

For this to achieve, we need to break down the problem in multiple steps.
[[How to solve a problem]] has more instructions

When we have the steps, we can now analyze our available algorithm and choose which one fits the best to solve our problem . This process in known as [[Algorithmic Thinking]]

For example , if the problem is to find a number between 1-100, and we use [[Linear Search]] and [[Binary Search]] both , for the number we want to find changes the algoritms number of steps . 

if the nubmer is 5 , then for [[Linear Search]] it would only require 5 steps but [[Binary Search]] would need 7 steps here. 

but, if the nubmer is 100 which is worst case scenario for [[Linear Search]] steps to take for it would be 100  whereas for [[Binary Search]] it will remain 7. 

so , while computing the efficiency of a algorithm, we need to take consideration the worst case scenario to find the actual efficiencies
