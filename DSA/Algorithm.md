A set of steps or instructions for completing a task
- It can be as simple as a To-do list of daily task
- Driving directions to reach a destination is an algorithm
In CS, 
>A set of steps a program takes to finish a task or solve a problem

### Properties of Algorithm
- It needs to have clearly defined problem statement, inputs and outputs.
- The steps in a algorithm need to be in a very specific order
- The steps needs to be distinct( shouldn't contain sub-tasks)
- The algorithm should produce a result
- The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time
- executing the steps of an algorithm for a given input must result in the same output no matter  how many times  it is executed. 

Described in [[Linear Search]] more specifically about these properties

A problem may have Multiple solutions , but , we need to select the best solutions. This in known as [[Algorithmic Thinking]]

## Advantage of Learning about Algorithm
- Deeper knowledge about the efficiency  and complexity

Interviewers don't care about you write the correct algorithm in code or not , but , rather, they look at if you are able to break down the problem into its core pieces and select the appropriate tools to solve the problem.
